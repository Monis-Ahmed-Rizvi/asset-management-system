# Asset Management System

## Project Overview
The Asset Management System is a cutting-edge, microservices-based solution designed for the energy sector, specifically tailored for companies like Baker Hughes. This system provides a comprehensive suite of tools for tracking, maintaining, and optimizing assets across large-scale operations.

## Key Features (Planned)
- Real-time asset tracking and monitoring
- Predictive maintenance using advanced analytics and machine learning
- Inventory management and optimization
- Customizable dashboards and detailed reporting
- Role-based access control for enhanced security
- Mobile-friendly interface for on-the-go access
- IoT device integration for real-time data collection
- Automated notification system for critical events and anomalies
- Energy efficiency tracking and optimization

## Architecture
The system is built on a robust microservices architecture, leveraging the latest in Spring Boot and Spring Cloud technologies. It consists of the following services:

1. **Asset Service**: Core service for managing asset information, lifecycle, and status.
2. **Maintenance Service**: Handles maintenance schedules, work orders, and predictive maintenance algorithms.
3. **Inventory Service**: Manages spare parts, supplies, and optimizes inventory levels.
4. **Monitoring Service**: Provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and data collection from assets and IoT devices.
5. **Analytics Service**: Offers deep insights, trend analysis, and predictive modeling capabilities.
6. **User Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and role-based access control.
7. **Notification Service**: Handles system-wide notifications, alerts, and communication.
8. **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to appropriate services.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Java 17
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Cloud
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka (planned) for event-driven architecture
- **Search and Analytics**: Elasticsearch (planned) for powerful search and analytics capabilities
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (planned) for container orchestration and scaling
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins or GitHub Actions (planned) for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana (planned) for system monitoring and visualization

## Getting Started
(This section will be updated with detailed instructions as the project progresses)

To set up the development environment:
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have Java 17 and Maven installed
3. Run `mvn clean install` in the root directory
4. Start each service using `mvn spring-boot:run` in their respective directories

## API Documentation
API documentation will be available through Swagger UI once the project reaches that stage of development.

## Deployment
(Detailed deployment instructions will be provided as the project matures)

The system is designed to be deployed as a set of microservices, either on-premises or in a cloud environment. Docker containers will be used to ensure consistency across different environments.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with blockchain for immutable asset records and enhanced security
- Expansion of analytics capabilities to include more advanced machine learning models
- Development of a companion mobile application for field operators
- Integration with augmented reality (AR) for maintenance assistance
- Implementation of digital twin technology for advanced simulation and prediction
